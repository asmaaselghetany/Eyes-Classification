# Eyes Classification

This project aims to classify images of eyes into different categories using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The goal is to build a classification model that can predict whether an image contains "open" or "closed" eyes. This model can be useful for applications in facial recognition, security systems, and user interface enhancements.

## **Project Overview**

The **Eyes Classification** project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, one of the most powerful models for image classification tasks. The dataset consists of images labeled as "open" or "closed" eyes. The model is trained to accurately classify these images based on pixel-level features, leveraging deep learning techniques.

## **Key Features**

- **Image Preprocessing**: Data augmentation, resizing, and normalization to enhance model generalization.
- **Deep Learning Model**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using **Keras** and **TensorFlow** for image classification.
- **Training**: Training the model on a labeled image dataset to predict eye states (open/closed).
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- **Visualization**: Graphs and charts for model training and evaluation to visualize performance.
